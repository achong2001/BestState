    "text": "1 Introduction\n\nFor our project, we will mainly be answering the question of what are the best states in the U.S to reside in. Each of the 50 states has its own unique qualities, in which we will focus more on their pragmatic characteristics: safety, quality of life, and education. We searched for various types of socioeconomic and population data that could impact the decision making of house buyers. This decision making is typically performed subjectively based on specific features that house buyers will prioritize when searching for a new state to live in. However, house buyers may vary, such as retirees, young couples, and families with kids, so we will create our own indicators that categorize features that those types of homeowners would prioritize to determine the best state to live in depending on their circumstances. Thus, we can delve into various other subquestions such as: Which state provides the safest environment? Which state provides the most secure future for the youth? Our question can also be answered objectively through the observation of trends in graphs for all of the variables to determine the overall best state to live in for any type of homeowner.\n\n\nWe believe these questions are important to study because they will be relevant to us and our peers as our job search preferences also depend on the site location. As we transition to different stages of adulthood, this study will always be significant for us to maximize our opportunities. Furthermore, our discoveries from the quality of states would not only benefit individual households but also improve the general quality of life in the U.S as everyone will have a deeper understanding of the living options that best fit their livelihood. We will leverage the data visualization tools that we learned throughout this semester to transform our datasets into compelling narratives that display how states measure up to the conclusion of what are the best states in the U.S."

In order answer the broad question of which is the best states within U.S to live in, we have chose and we will assess indicators of different aspects that can represent the living standards, including population demographics, health, Economic status, safety, education attainment and employment status in 50 states in the U.S. All the indicators are from year 2022, given that it is the most recent full-year record.\nBelow are the description for each columns in the dataset including their original sources, grouped by indicators of each aspects:\nSTATES: Names of the 50 states in the U.S, excluding minor islands.\nDemography Indicators:\nPOPULATION: Number of population in each state of United States as of 2022.

    "text": "2.2 Research Plan\n\nOur current data will provide a baseline answer for our research questions in determining which states are best for specific household circumstances. Economics, education, health, and safety indicators are four of the most important factors that new homeowners would consider. Retirees most likely prefer to live in states with the best health features above all others, so a higher health indicator would include lower crime and poverty rates. Families with children may prioritize education the most, where there are higher rates of high school graduates and under 18 residents in order to provide a more kid-friendly environment. Young couples may prioritize states with higher gini indexes and higher employment rates because they would focus on financial stability at their age to pay off debts and potentially save to have children. Gini index measures the income distribution across the state’s population. A value of 0 represents perfect equality (straight diagonal line) for an equal balance of people in all income brackets whereas a curved line represents imbalance in certain brackets. A value of 1 represents perfect inequality, where only the last person in the entire population gets all of the wealth, thus a straight line is formed at 100% of population.\n\n\nOur demographic and peers would lean more towards the category of young couples, where we prioritize financial stability. After visualizing the states that offer the most financial stability from our study, we can then filter our job search on locations based at these states, in which this process will provide us with an improve quality of life."
