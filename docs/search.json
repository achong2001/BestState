    "text": "1 Introduction\n\nFor our project, we will mainly be answering the question of what are the best states in the U.S to reside in. Each of the 50 states has its own unique qualities, in which we will focus more on their pragmatic characteristics: safety, quality of life, and education. We searched for various types of socioeconomic and population data that could impact the decision making of house buyers. This decision making is typically performed subjectively based on specific features that house buyers will prioritize when searching for a new state to live in. However, house buyers may vary, such as retirees, young couples, and families with kids, so we will create our own indicators that categorize features that those types of homeowners would prioritize to determine the best state to live in depending on their circumstances. Thus, we can delve into various other subquestions such as: Which state provides the safest environment? Which state provides the most secure future for the youth? Our question can also be answered objectively through the observation of trends in graphs for all of the variables to determine the overall best state to live in for any type of homeowner.\n\n\nWe believe these questions are important to study because they will be relevant to us and our peers as our job search preferences also depend on the site location. As we transition to different stages of adulthood, this study will always be significant for us to maximize our opportunities. Furthermore, our discoveries from the quality of states would not only benefit individual households but also improve the general quality of life in the U.S as everyone will have a deeper understanding of the living options that best fit their livelihood. We will leverage the data visualization tools that we learned throughout this semester to transform our datasets into compelling narratives that display how states measure up to the conclusion of what are the best states in the U.S."

This result is expected due to two reasons: First, this is a rather small dataset with 50 rows and 13 columns so that the data is likely to be avaliable given the size. Second, considering the authority of the sources of data, including fbi, cdc, and U.S. Census Bureau, which gaurenteed the quality and credibility of the data."

    "text": "2.1 Technical Description\n\nIn order to answer the broad question of which is the best states within U.S to live in, we will assess factors across different living aspects that can provide indication od desirability for different households, which include economics, education, health, and safety indicators. Thus we have collected the data from multiple sources(U.S.Census Bureau, Federal Bureau of Investigation, Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, US Department of Commerce, and Mental Health America) where each being the authority on the given asepct.\n\n\nThe dataset has 50 rows and 13 columns, where each row represents each state in the United States, excluding minor island, and each column represent each indictor of the living condition in each state (e.g population, crime rates, high school graudation rates.) All the data are collected from the year of 2022, given that this is the most recent full year.\n\n\nPOPULATION, U18, OVER60, POVERTY, HSGRADUATE, EMPLOYMENT, and GINI columns are gathered from U.S. Census Bureau for 50 states across United States. All the columns here are presented in termns of number of population excpet for GINI, which is an index data that goes from 0 to 1 The data from U.S. Census Bureau are collected through the census survey each year, such that the result are updated every 12 months.\n\n\nOBESE and INFM columns are collected from cdc, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention for 50 states across United States. These two columns are presented in terms of the percentage. Their data are collected from various health insititutions including hospitals and local doctor’s office. The data is nomrally updated yearly.\n\n\nThe MENTAL column is collected from Mental Health America. This is a ranking goes from 1- 51. The ranking is Made up by 7 measures combined,including Adults with Any Mental Illness (AMI), Adults with Substance Use Disorder in the Past Year, Adults with Serious Thoughts of Suicide, Adults with AMI who Did Not Receive Treatment, Adults with AMI Reporting Unmet Need, Adults with AMI who are Uninsured, and Adults with Cognitive Disability Who Could Not See a Doctor Due to Costs. States that are ranked 1-10 have lower prevalence of mental illness and higher rates of access to care for adults. States that are ranked 39-51 indicate that adults have higher prevalence of mental illness and lower rates of access to care. All of the data presented in the MHA is collected through the MHA Online Screening Program.\n\n\nThe INCOME column is collected from Bureau of Economic Analysis. It presents the per capita personal income in U.S dollars across 50 states. Most data from bea are sourced from surveies and sponsored by fedueral agencies.\n\n\nThe CRIME column is collected from Federal Bureau of Investigation. Note that this column is not in percentage or in numbers while it present the number of reperted crime per 100,000 of the population. The data in FBI are collected from the monthly reports from their agencies.\n\n\nBelow are the description for each columns including their original sources:\n\n\nSTATES: Names of the 50 states in the U.S, excluding minor islands.\n\n\nPOPULATION: Number of population in each state of United States as of 2022.\n\n\nU18: Number of population who is under the age of 18 in each state of United States as of 2022.\n\n\nOVER60: Number of population who is over the age of 60 in each state of United States as of 2022.\n\n\nPOVERTY: percentage of people below poverty in the U.S by states in 2022.\n\n\nHSGRADUATE:Number of population with high school diploma or equivalence in each state of United States as of 2022.\n\n\nEMPLOYMENT: Number of employed population in each state of United States as of 2022.\n\n\nOriginal source for all above:https://data.census.gov/table/ACSST1Y2022.S1701?q=poverty%20by%20state\n\n\nOBESE: Percentage of adults with obesity in the United States as of 2022 by state.Original source: https://www.statista.com/statistics/378988/us-obesity-rate-by-state/\n\n\nINFM: The infant mortality rates by states in 2022.

    "text": "2.2 Research Plan\n\nOur current data will provide a baseline answer for our research questions in determining which states are best for specific household circumstances. Economics, education, health, and safety indicators are four of the most important factors that new homeowners would consider. Retirees most likely prefer to live in states with the best health features above all others, so a higher health indicator would include lower crime and poverty rates. Families with children may prioritize education the most, where there are higher rates of high school graduates and under 18 residents in order to provide a more kid-friendly environment. Young couples may prioritize states with higher gini indexes and higher employment rates because they would focus on financial stability at their age to pay off debts and potentially save to have children. Gini index measures the income distribution across the state’s population. A value of 0 represents perfect equality (straight diagonal line) for an equal balance of people in all income brackets whereas a curved line represents imbalance in certain brackets. A value of 1 represents perfect inequality, where only the last person in the entire population gets all of the wealth, thus a straight line is formed at 100% of population.\n\n\nOur demographic and peers would lean more towards the category of young couples, where we prioritize financial stability. After visualizing the states that offer the most financial stability from our study, we can then filter our job search on locations based at these states, in which this process will provide us with an improved quality of life."
